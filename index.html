        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Rachel Salim. I am a second year Biology major at University of California-Riverside. I am currently taking the pre-medicine route in aspiring to become a physician. During my free time I've spent most of it watching movies to destress from the struggles of a pre-med college student. Movies have brought me comfort, laughter, and motivation. Not a week goes by where I don't watch something, whether it be from the television, Netflix, or even Youtube. I‚Äôve watched movies since I was a child, and have always been intrigued by the methods and techniques that go into making a movie and what makes a movie deserve a five star rating. From doing my research on rotten tomatoes or imdb and comparing it to the ratings of my own, I‚Äôve found a way to share my experience all while enjoying my love for watching movies. Movies are what keep me company when I‚Äôm getting ready, or winding down, so it‚Äôs important for me to find ones that will make me feel the most intrigues with the short amount of free time that I have and suit my type of film. My friends have also shared the same taste in movies, and have asked about my reviews<br><br>

        I'm very passionate about watching all kinds of movies. From Romantic Comedy to Thrillers to Action movies I have enjoyed them all. My mood tends to dictate the genre I choose to review and how well I view the movie. The topics I review for the movies consist of the setting the movie takes place in, the quality of the actors and actresses and how well they matched and played their characters, the picture quality, the background props relating to the subject of the movie or the time period, and how the movie made me feel overall and the quality of the storyline. Not a day goes by that I don‚Äôt have a movie playing in the background. Movies have become my comfort zone. Movies have become a sort of art form for me. The acting, the scenery, and the storyline of some movies could bring tears to people and bring out emotions that no other art form could in that way. Movies have the power to change your day. Whenever I feel upset I know that watching a good comedy could make me laugh. Which is why reviews are important, so that you don‚Äôt waste time watching something that won‚Äôt benefit you.<br><br>

        Reviewing movies has become a creative outlet for me where I can rate and sort through my emotions as I watch the various types of movies. Watching the Oscars and the Tony Awards have made me realize how great of an honor it is for actresses and actors and directors to be recognized by how good they are, and even the costume makers and producers, and animators. Everyone enjoys reading through movie reviews before they invest their time in watching one. I don‚Äôt think my love for movies and rating them will ever stop.
